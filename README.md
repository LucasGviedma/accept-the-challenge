# Embrace-the-challenge (Acepta el reto!)

**Official website: https://www.aceptaelreto.com/**

In this repository you will find certain solutions that I have come up with to solve some of the problems posed by the "Accept the challenge" website.
Feel free to ask any questions about them or, given the case, to send me your own solutions!
As almost always happens when programming, I do not assure you that these are the best solutions to the problems raised, but I hope they'll be useful to those who are curious!

The problems will be solved in python, since I don't think the owners of the original web page (which allows users to send their solutions) would like to have already made solutions for their challenges in the languages they accept: C, C ++ and Java.

Welcome aboard!
