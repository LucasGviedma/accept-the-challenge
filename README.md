"ProgramaMe"
In this repository you'll be able to find the different solutions i come up with for the ProgramaMe Spanish coding competition.
Feel free to ask any questions about them or, given the case, to send me your own solutions!
As almost always happens when programming, I do not assure you that these are the best solutions to the problems raised, but I hope they will be useful to those who are curious!
I'll be coding on Python, but i might add versions in other languages too.

Welcome aboard!
